# Expedito: Chronicles of Exoplanets Exploration

## Project Overview
This repository is for the NASA Space Apps challenge titled **Chronicles of Exoplanets Exploration**. Our team is developing a **card game** called **Expedito**, aimed at revolutionizing the way exoplanet education is delivered. The game will be designed to engage players and provide accessible knowledge about the discovery and characteristics of exoplanets, from gas giants to potentially habitable rocky worlds.

## Challenge Description
The discovery of exoplanets has redefined our understanding of planetary systems, expanding what we know about our place in the universe. These distant worlds showcase the incredible diversity of planetary configurations. However, traditional educational resources about this topic may not be accessible to everyone, especially those from underserved communities.

### Our Solution
We aim to address this issue by developing an accessible card game, **Expedito**, that will be available through a Flutter-based mobile application. This app will provide users with an engaging and educational experience, allowing them to explore and learn about the wonders of exoplanets in a fun and interactive way.

## Features
- **Card Game Mechanics**: Players will explore various exoplanets by drawing cards with unique characteristics and configurations.
- **Educational Content**: Information about each exoplanet will be provided, allowing players to learn as they play.
- **Flutter Application**: The game will be accessible as a mobile application, built using Flutter for cross-platform support.

## Tech Stack
- **Flutter**: For the mobile application development.
- **Dart**: Primary language for the Flutter application.
- **Game Design**: Custom-designed card game mechanics to simplify exoplanet exploration.
