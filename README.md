# Expedito: Chronicles of Exoplanets Exploration

## Project Overview
Welcome to **Expedito**, an educational card game designed as part of the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**, under the theme **Chronicles of Exoplanets Exploration**. Our goal is to transform the way exoplanetary science is taught and experienced. With **Expedito**, we aim to create a captivating and accessible learning tool, allowing players to explore the fascinating worlds of exoplanetsâ€”ranging from colossal gas giants to potentially habitable rocky planets.

## Challenge Description
The discovery of exoplanets has significantly expanded our understanding of planetary systems beyond our own. These far-off worlds exhibit a stunning diversity in their characteristics, redefining what we know about the universe. Despite these groundbreaking discoveries, the educational resources surrounding this subject often remain inaccessible to many, especially those in underserved communities.

### Our Solution
We are addressing this challenge by developing **Expedito**, an educational card game complemented by a mobile application that offers deeper insights into exoplanets, enhanced with NASA's cutting-edge visualizations. The game is designed to provide an engaging and interactive way to explore exoplanetary science, making learning both fun and accessible for all audiences.
