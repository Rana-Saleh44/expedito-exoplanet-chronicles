# Expedito: Chronicles of Exoplanets Exploration

## Project Overview
This repository is for the NASA Space Apps challenge titled **Chronicles of Exoplanets Exploration**. Our team is developing a **card game** called **Expedito**, aimed at revolutionizing the way exoplanet education is delivered. The game will be designed to engage players and provide accessible knowledge about the discovery and characteristics of exoplanets, from gas giants to potentially habitable rocky worlds.

## Challenge Description
The discovery of exoplanets has redefined our understanding of planetary systems, expanding what we know about our place in the universe. These distant worlds showcase the incredible diversity of planetary configurations. However, traditional educational resources about this topic may not be accessible to everyone, especially those from underserved communities.

### Our Solution
We aim to address this issue by developing an accessible card game, **Expedito**, integrated with mobile application for extra knowledge about the exoplanets and NASA's visualization. This app will provide users with an engaging and educational experience, allowing them to explore and learn about the wonders of exoplanets in a fun and interactive way.
